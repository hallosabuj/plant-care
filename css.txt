display = property specifies how an element is displayed
block-level = start on a new line, take upto full width available (hi, div, p, form, header, footer)
inline = do not start on a new line, width is limited to what is needed (span, img, a)
values = block(height, width), inline(no-height, no-width), inline-block(inline but can have height and width), none(will erase the element)
==================================================
visibility = hidden(element will be hidden but will take up space)
==================================================
position
values =    static(default) 
            absolute: any element that is abosulutely positioned will search for a parent that is not statically positioned, if it does not have any parent it will use the viewport. top/left/right/bottom can be used. Absolute elementgoes over other elements in general
            fixed: fixed will stay in position of our viewport, will fix the element to the window/viewport, top/left/right/bottom can be used.
            relative : makes an empty space and position the element relative to its original position, top/left/right/bottom can be used.
            sticky: stick to a position of our viewport on reaching sticking point, top/left/right/bottom can be used.

            fixed and absolute element covers other elements
==================================================
flex 
This can be used as a value of display property
If we use flex we can use multiple other properties which are:
justify-content: This justify the content along the main axis
                 Values: flex-start/flex-end/center//space-between/space-around/space-evenly
align-items:      This align the content along the cross axis
                 If there are multiple cross-axis it will affect multiple cross-axis.
                 It controls alignment along cross axis of every flexbox line individually 
                 Values: flex-start/flex-end/center//space-between/space-around/space-evenly   
align-content:   This is to aling whole content of the flexbox along cross-axis
                 Controls the alignment of all aligns together
                 Values: flex-start/flex-end/center//space-between/space-around/space-evenly
gap:             For providing gaps between the items
                 Values: 0px/1px...
column-gap:      For providing gaps between the columns
                 Values: 0px/1px...
row-gap:         For providing gaps between the rows
                 Values: 0px/1px...
flex-wrap:       To enable wrap in case of content overflow
                 Values: wrap/nowrap
flex-shrink:     To enable/disable shrinking of the flex elements
                 Value: 0(disable)/1 or higher(enable), 1 is default value, more the value more faster the box will shrink
flex-grow:       To enable/disable growing of the flex elements
                 Values: 0(disable)/1 or higher (enable), 0 is default value, more the value more faster the box will grow
align-self:      To align a particular flex element
                 Value: flex-start/flex-end/center

=================================================
To make glass effect use following in the glass element:
    White background color with 5% opacity
    Set backdrop-filter: blur(10px)
=================================================
To apply gradient to the text:
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);
    background-clip: text;
    color: transparent;
=================================================
For better scrolling use:
    scroll-snap-type: x mandatory (in parent element)
    scroll-snap-position: center  (in child element)
